# Reed_Solomon_Algorithm
Reed Solomon encode and decode algorithm research.

The original code is from matlab File Exchange.
I also do some optimize work.

The new feature is below:
* The poly degree m is configurable
* The primepoly is configurable
* The generatepoly "b" is confugrable
* Support short code. The code length is not match 2^m-1;
